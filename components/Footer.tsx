/**
 * Footer for callhouse.xyz. Server component — there is nothing here to hydrate, and this
 * package has no client runtime to spend on a row of links.
 *
 * The markup is the dapp's footer in leekzor/callhouse: `web/app/layout.tsx` (.footer /
 * .footer-inner, same type scale, same separators) so the bottom of the two domains matches. Three
 * rows, in this order:
 *
 *   1. what this is — product, share ticker, collateral, chain.
 *   2. where to go  — the four disclosure pages and the explainer first, then the two links that
 *                     leave this domain. Legal leads because it is the row's reason for existing;
 *                     Terms and Privacy follow it because they are the documents /legal cites.
 *   3. the standing disclaimers, carried word for word from the dapp's footer. They are copied
 *      rather than shared: this repo builds with no dependency on the dapp. If one is reworded,
 *      reword both in paired commits across the two repos, or the same sentence reads two ways on
 *      two hostnames.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT: the dapp's "vault contract ↗" link. The vault is not deployed, lib/site.ts
 * carries no address for it, and a footer link to nothing is worse than no link.
 *
 * ALSO DELIBERATELY ABSENT: a link to the source repository. It may not be public, and a dead
 * "source" link in a footer reads as a withdrawn claim. What a reader actually needs from that
 * link is the audit status, so the last row states it outright instead: the contracts in this
 * repository have not been audited. That line is not in the dapp's footer; it belongs here,
 * where people read before they deposit.
