/**
 * The one place this package knows a URL, a ticker or an address.
 *
 * Two domains, one product: callhouse.finance is this package (static marketing, zero wallet code) and
 * app.callhouse.finance is @callhouse/web in leekzor/callhouse (the dapp). Nothing here is same-origin
 * with the app, so every "go do something" link must be an absolute external URL built with
 * appUrl() — a bare href="/vault/nvda" on this site is a 404 on callhouse.finance, not a route into the
 * dapp.
 *
 * The constants below are DUPLICATED FROM leekzor/callhouse: `web/lib/contracts.ts`,
 * `web/lib/chain.ts` and `README.md` ON PURPOSE. This repo must build, typecheck and deploy with no
 * dependency on the dapp — it is a separate repo and Railway service with its own container, and a
 * shared package would drag viem (and therefore a wallet-shaped dependency tree) into a landing
 * page that makes no chain calls at all. This file DISPLAYS these addresses; it never calls them.
 * If an address changes, leekzor/callhouse: `README.md` and `ops/addresses.json` are the source of
 * truth and this file is updated by hand to match.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: chain clients, ABIs, a vault address (the vault is not deployed, and a
 * placeholder would be worse than not showing one), and anything that reads live state. Every
 * number on this site is a fixed policy parameter, not a quote.
