/**
 * When a "?" InfoTip shows its explanation: a "?" icon a reader can hover
 * over, which explains itself after more than 1 second. Pure and timer-injected, so the
 * rules run under vitest's node environment without a DOM; components/ui/InfoTip.tsx wires the DOM events to it.
 *
 *   hover     a mouse or pen resting on the icon opens it after INFO_TIP_DELAY_MS. Leaving first cancels; leaving
 *             after it opened closes it, unless a tap or the keyboard opened it.
 *   tap       a press (touch, or a click) toggles it at once. Touch never starts the hover timer: a finger does not
 *             hover, and a browser's emulated mouseenter on tap must not open it a second later.
 *   keyboard  focus from the keyboard opens it at once. Focus that came with a pointer press does not, or the click
 *             that follows would toggle it straight back shut.
 *   close     Escape and blur close it, and cancel a pending hover.
