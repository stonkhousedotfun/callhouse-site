/**
 * /.well-known/security.txt — RFC 9116, the file a researcher looks for before anything else.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE: stonkhouse.fun is the indexed domain and the one a stranger reaches first;
 * stonkhousedotfun/callhouse: `SECURITY.md` §6 points at this path. It is a route handler rather than a file
 * in public/ because the Contact line is NEXT_PUBLIC_SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL from lib/legal.ts and
 * the Expires line is derived from LEGAL_DOCS_VERSION — a static file would have to be edited by
 * hand in step with both, and would drift.
 *
 * WHILE NO SECURITY CONTACT IS SET THIS ROUTE RETURNS 404, on purpose. RFC 9116 §2.5.3 makes
 * `Contact:` mandatory, and a security.txt with no way to reach anyone is worse than none:
 * scanners parse it as a valid policy and stop looking, and a researcher who finds it reads
 * "this project thought about disclosure" on a file that says nothing. A 404 tells the truth
 * (there is no disclosure address yet), and the body says so in one line so it is not mistaken
 * for a missing route. stonkhousedotfun/callhouse: `ops/launch-legal.md` lists setting the address as a
 * launch step; until then stonkhousedotfun/callhouse: `SECURITY.md` §6 carries the same gap in words.
 *
 * `dynamic = "force-static"`: every input is a build-time constant (NEXT_PUBLIC_* is inlined by
 * `next build`, LEGAL_DOCS_VERSION is a literal, and securityTxtExpires() reads no clock), so
 * the response is the same bytes for the life of the image and Next can emit it at build. A
 * change to the address is a rebuild, exactly like every other NEXT_PUBLIC_* on this site.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: `Encryption:` (no PGP key has been published — adding a key nobody
 * checks is the same mistake as a mailbox nobody reads), `Acknowledgments:` (there is nothing
 * to acknowledge yet), `Hiring:`, and a signature (RFC 9116 §2.3 recommends one, which needs
 * the same key; it is on the launch checklist, not in the code).
