/**
 * Root layout for callhouse.finance.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT: a <Providers> wrapper. leekzor/callhouse: `web/app/layout.tsx` has one
 * because the dapp needs wagmi, viem and @tanstack/react-query mounted above every route. This
 * package has none of those as dependencies and must never acquire them — that is the entire point
 * of splitting the two domains. A marketing page that ships a wallet runtime pays for a connect
 * flow it will never offer, and the vault is not deployed yet, so every live figure it could render
 * would be a zero. Nothing under this layout fetches, reads a chain, or holds client state beyond
 * the nav's active link. If a page here ever needs a provider, the page belongs on
 * app.callhouse.finance.
 *
 * `metadataBase` is callhouse.finance because that is where this package is served; relative
 * canonicals and Open Graph URLs resolve against it, and without it Next falls back to localhost
 * in a production build.
 *
 * THE robots DECISION — index: true HERE, and index: false in leekzor/callhouse:
 * `web/app/layout.tsx`. The pairing is the point, and the two files have to be changed together,
 * in paired commits across the two repos:
 *
 *   - This domain carries the canonical /legal, /risks and /how-it-works copy. Serving the same
 *     disclosures from two hostnames is duplicate content, and duplicate content lets a search
 *     engine pick which of the two it shows. The disclosures get one address, and it is this one.
 *   - This is the surface scripts/copy-lint.mjs was written for. The page a stranger finds first
 *     should be the page whose wording is checked on every build.
 *
 * The title template exists so a route only has to name itself: `title: "Risks"` renders
 * "Risks — Callhouse". The default is the full positioning line, used on "/" alone.
