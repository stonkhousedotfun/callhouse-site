/**
 * callhouse.xyz/ — the landing page, and the first thing a stranger reads about this product.
 *
 * One job: leave a reader who skims only the first screen with an ACCURATE expectation. That
 * expectation is not a number, it is a shape — the vault writes one call a week against pooled
 * collateral, the premium arrives only if somebody buys the call, and on a thin book the most
 * likely week is the one that pays nothing. The hero says that in words, the first figure on the
 * page says it as a zero, and the outcomes card says it again with the unfilled week listed
 * first. If a future edit moves that below the fold, the edit is wrong.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT:
 *   - Wallet code of any kind. No wagmi, no viem, no query client, no connect button. This is a
 *     server component with no "use client", no hooks and no fetch; it renders identically with
 *     JavaScript switched off, which is the whole reason this site is a separate repo from the
 *     dapp.
 *   - Live data. The vault is not deployed. A chain read here would render zeros, and a zero that
 *     really means "not deployed yet" is a lie told in a number. The notice below the hero says
 *     so in words instead.
 *   - Any forward-looking figure, and any figure scaled past one week. Every number on this page
 *     is a fixed policy parameter from README "Policy (launch)" or a protocol constant.
 *     scripts/copy-lint.mjs fails CI on the vocabulary; this file avoids the shape as well, and
 *     therefore needs no `copy-lint-allow` escape hatch anywhere in it. Do not add one: the
 *     escape hatch has to sit on the same physical line as the phrase, so any later reformat of
 *     this file would silently break the build.
 *   - The full policy table, the fee table, the phase machine and the addresses table. All four
 *     live on /how-it-works, which owns them. Repeating them here would push the material a
 *     depositor actually needs below three screens of reference data.
 *
 * Three phrases are required verbatim on this route by scripts/copy-lint.mjs. They are written
 * into the sentences that carry the argument — the hero, the assignment card and the pre-deposit
 * list — and not parked in a disclaimer block, because a disclaimer is the part nobody reads:
 *   "Premium is paid only if a buyer fills"
 *   "Assignment can take the collateral at the strike"
 *   "Stock Tokens are debt securities"
 * Reword those sentences only with `node scripts/copy-lint.mjs` open.
 *
 * Every "go do something" link leaves for app.callhouse.xyz through appUrl(). A relative href on
 * this domain is a 404, not a route into the dapp.
