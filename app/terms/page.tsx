/**
 * /terms — Terms of Use for both domains. Adopted 2026-09-13 as v1 (see LEGAL_DOCS_VERSION in
 * lib/legal.ts).
 *
 * WHY THIS PAGE EXISTS: /legal says access is restricted by the Terms of Use rather than by a
 * technical control, and until 2026-09-12 there was no such document. A restriction that points
 * at nothing is not a restriction. This page is the thing that sentence points at, on the
 * indexed domain, canonical here and linked from app.callhouse.xyz rather than duplicated there.
 *
 * WHAT STILL GAPS: no operating entity has been designated and no governing law has been chosen.
 * The page renders those gaps in plain words from lib/legal.ts instead of hiding them behind a
 * placeholder, and shows a warn notice while operatorIsDesignated() is false.
 * leekzor/callhouse: `ops/launch-legal.md` is the list of decisions that closes it. The text was
 * adopted by the owner, reviewed against the code, without counsel; the DraftMarker machinery
 * remains so a future revision can be published as a draft before it takes force.
 *
 * The eligibility section is copied VERBATIM from app/legal/page.tsx, because the terms cannot
 * describe the perimeter differently from the page that announces it. "not available to US
 * persons" on this page is a literal match required by scripts/copy-lint.mjs, as is "Draft"; if
 * either is reworded the build fails. Keep this page and /legal in the same commit when the
 * perimeter wording changes.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT: an "I accept" control (there is no account to attach acceptance to and a
 * checkbox would imply a gate that does not exist — whether use-based acceptance is defensible
 * for this perimeter is a counsel question, listed in leekzor/callhouse: `ops/launch-legal.md`),
 * clause numbering
 * (the sections are not cross-referenced, so numbers would be decoration), a geoblock, and any
 * sentence that promises an outcome. Nothing here is legal advice.

        These terms cover callhouse.xyz and app.callhouse.xyz (together, &ldquo;the
        interface&rdquo;). Using either domain is use under these terms. If you do not agree with
        them, do not use the interface. The smart contracts the interface points at are on a public
        chain and are not governed by these terms; nothing here can change what they do.
      </p>

      <h2>Who may use this</h2>
      <div className="notice" data-tone="bad">
        <strong>This interface is not available to US persons.</strong>
        The same perimeter applies as to the underlying Stock Tokens. If you are a US person, or you
        are accessing this from a jurisdiction where these instruments are not offered, do not use
        this interface.
      </div>
      <ul className="tight">
        <li>
          Callhouse is <strong>not available to US persons</strong>, and nothing on this site is an
          offer or solicitation to any person in any jurisdiction where such an offer would be
          unlawful.
        </li>
        <li>
          Robinhood Chain Stock Tokens are offered outside the United States under their issuer&apos;s
          own terms and eligibility rules. Those rules govern whether you may hold the collateral at
          all; this interface does not widen them and cannot waive them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Access is restricted by these terms, not by a technical control. You are responsible for
          your own eligibility, and for any tax or reporting consequence of using this interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          No know-your-customer process is run here, and none is implied. This is a permissionless
          smart contract on a public chain.
        </li>
      </ul>
      {/* Terms-only: the age, capacity and sanctions representation is not restated on /legal. */}
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter a binding agreement, and you must not
        be barred from using the interface by sanctions or by the law of your jurisdiction. By
        using the interface you represent that both are true.
      </p>

      <h2>What this interface is</h2>
      <ul className="tight">
        <li>
          A front-end to public smart contracts on Robinhood Chain. It builds transactions; your
          wallet signs them; the chain executes them. The interface never holds a key and never
          holds a token.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no custody. {MARKET} Stock Tokens you deposit are held by the vault contract and,
          during a written week, by the Valorem clearinghouse. The vault has no upgrade path and no
          function that moves a depositor&apos;s tokens anywhere but back to the depositor or into
          the written call; the Admin Safe can change policy inside compiled-in caps and cannot
          move a token.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no account. Nothing is registered, no password exists, and no know-your-customer
          check is run. Your wallet address is the only identity the interface sees, and it is
          public chain data.
        </li>
        <li>
          The same contracts are reachable without this interface, from any tool that can send a
          transaction. Withdrawing does not depend on this site staying up.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
      <ul className="tight">
        <li>Use the interface only for lawful purposes, in your jurisdiction and in general.</li>
        <li>
          Do not attack or interfere with the interface: no exploiting a weakness to take what is
          not yours, no disruptive automation, no impersonation. If you find a vulnerability,{" "}
          <Link href="/legal#reporting">report it</Link> instead of using it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not misrepresent this interface as affiliated with Robinhood, {VENUE_NAME}, Valorem
          or any other third party it names. It is not; <Link href="/legal">the legal page</Link>{" "}
          says so in full.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>No advice, no offer</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing on the interface is investment, legal, tax or accounting advice, and nothing here is
        an offer of securities or an invitation to buy or sell anything. Published weekly results
        describe what has already happened and say nothing about what any future week will do. The
        interface does not know your circumstances and does not try to.
      </p>

      <h2>Risks</h2>
      <p>
        Premium is paid only if a buyer fills the weekly listing; a week with no buyer pays nothing.
        Assignment can take the collateral at the strike. The collateral is a debt security whose
        issuer can freeze transfers, and the vault cannot override that. You can lose the collateral
        you deposit. <Link href="/risks">The risks page</Link> is the full list and is part of these
        terms by reference; read it before depositing.
      </p>

      <h2>Smart-contract and third-party risk</h2>
      <ul className="tight">
        <li>
          The Callhouse contracts have not been audited. They are published under the MIT licence,
          as-is, and there is no upgrade path: a bug means a new vault and a migration, not a patch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a className="ext" href={VENUE_URL} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
            {VENUE_NAME}
          </a>
          , Valorem Clear, Seaport, the {MARKET} Stock Token, USDG and the RPC providers are third
          parties. None of them is operated by, or answerable to, the people who publish this
          interface. Their contracts can be paused or upgraded by their own admin keys, and the
          Stock Token issuer can freeze transfers or pause its oracle. When any of them stops, this
          vault stops with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The weekly cycle is set by a third-party registry key. A hostile or mistaken cycle is
          bounded by the vault&apos;s compiled-in checks to a skipped week, and no better than that.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>No warranty</h2>
      <p>
        The interface and the contracts it points at are provided as-is and as-available, with no
        warranty of any kind, express or implied, including of merchantability, fitness for a
        purpose, accuracy, or uninterrupted operation. Figures shown on app.callhouse.xyz are read
        from the chain or from an indexer and may lag or be wrong; the chain is the record, not the
        page.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent the applicable law allows, the people who publish this interface are not
        liable for any loss arising from its use or from the contracts it points at, including lost
        collateral, lost premium, assignment, a frozen token, a failed third party, an error on the
        page, or downtime. Where that exclusion is not permitted, liability is limited to the
        smallest amount the law allows. Nothing here excludes liability that cannot lawfully be
        excluded.
      </p>

      <h2>Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        You indemnify the people who publish this interface against any claim, loss or expense
        brought by a third party that arises from your breach of these terms or your unlawful use
        of the interface, and you hold them harmless against it.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>
        The contracts the interface points at are published under the MIT licence. The text and
        design of this site are not open-licensed: you may read them and link to them, and no
        other right is granted. Nothing here gives you any right to the Callhouse name or mark, or
        to the names and marks of the third parties this site names, which belong to their owners.
      </p>

      <h2>Ending these terms</h2>
      <p>
        You stop being bound by stopping using the interface. The interface may be suspended,
        changed or withdrawn at any time, without notice. The contracts it points at are on a
        public chain and do not depend on this site: withdrawing from the vault remains possible
        without it, from any tool that can send a transaction.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are versioned. The version in force is <code>{LEGAL_DOCS_VERSION}</code>. A
        change is a new version and a new date; there is no other notice. Continuing to use the
        interface after a change is use under the new version.
      </p>

      <h2>General</h2>
      <ul className="tight">
        <li>If a clause of these terms is unenforceable, the rest still apply.</li>
        <li>A failure to enforce a clause is not a waiver of it.</li>
        <li>
          These terms, the <Link href="/privacy">privacy notice</Link> and the{" "}
          <Link href="/risks">risks page</Link> are the whole agreement between you and the people
          who publish this interface about the interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may not assign these terms. The operator may assign them to a successor operator of
          the interface, who will be named on this page.
        </li>
        <li>There are no third-party beneficiaries to these terms.</li>
