/**
 * callhouse.finance/how-it-works — the mechanics, for someone who has not connected anything.
 *
 * This is the public sibling of the dapp's /docs page. The difference is the reader: there,
 * a depositor is looking at their own position, so the page can say "your tokens" and sit
 * next to live state. Here nobody has deposited, nothing is connected, and the vault is not
 * even deployed — so everything below is a fixed parameter, an address, or a rule, and the
 * reader is told which is which.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT: every number that could move. No cycle number, no strike, no premium,
 * no realized week, no TVL, no "current" anything — this package makes zero chain reads and
 * has no wallet code, and a live figure rendered before launch would be a zero next to a word
 * like "realized", which reads as a result rather than as an absence. Also absent: any figure
 * scaled past one week, any chart, and any statement of what a week will pay. The only weekly
 * numbers on this page are policy floors and ceilings compiled into the contracts.
 *
 * Every "go do something" link leaves for app.callhouse.finance via appUrl(). A relative href on
 * this domain is a 404, not a route into the dapp.

        <p className="small muted">
          The keeper binds to the {VENUE_NAME} registry&apos;s cycle, not to a wall clock. It
          watches the registry for an open write window and reads the deadlines from it; the days
          and times below are the venue&apos;s current window, not a promise Callhouse makes. If
          the registry moves the window, the vault moves with it.
        </p>

        <ol className="steps">
          <li className="step">
            <strong>The cycle opens.</strong> The registry publishes the week: up to five strike
            rungs, the write deadline it calls the exercise timestamp, and the expiry. Nothing can
            be written before this, and the vault has no calendar of its own.
          </li>
          <li className="step">
            <strong>The keeper picks a rung.</strong> The nearest {VENUE_NAME} rung that sits
            inside the out-of-the-money band — at launch, 3% to 12% above spot. If no rung
            qualifies, the vault writes nothing and holds the collateral for the week. A skipped
            week is a normal outcome.
          </li>
          <li className="step">
            <strong>It writes <code>n</code> calls against idle collateral.</strong> Idle
            collateral is locked in Valorem Clear and written as whole contracts, one contract per
            1.0000 Stock Token, capped at 95% of the idle balance. Collateral already locked in
            last week&apos;s call is not touched, and neither is anything deposited after the
            calls are written.
          </li>
          <li className="step">
            <strong>It signs a Seaport listing for USDG.</strong> The vault authorises the order
            by hash on chain and answers EIP-1271 as the offerer; the keeper posts it to{" "}
            {VENUE_NAME}&apos;s book. At most three listings are signed per cycle. The keeper
            never holds the option tokens and can never move funds.
          </li>
          <li className="step">
            <strong>The book closes.</strong> Friday 20:00 UTC in the venue&apos;s current window
            — the registry&apos;s exercise timestamp is the real deadline. After it, nothing more
            is written and nothing more is listed. Closing the book is permissionless from that
            moment, so a dead keeper cannot hold the week open.
          </li>
          <li className="step">
            <strong>Expiry.</strong> Saturday 20:00 UTC. By then the call has either been
            exercised by whoever bought it, or it has expired worth nothing to them.
          </li>
          <li className="step">
            <strong>Reclaim, harvest, distribute.</strong> The vault redeems its Valorem claim —
            collateral back, or strike USDG instead where it was assigned — harvests the USDG,
            takes the protocol fee on the premium alone, credits the rest per share with any strike
            USDG in full, settles the redemption queue, and returns to Idle. The keeper may do this at expiry; anyone may do it an hour later.

              vault writes the same option series as other writers, and Valorem assigns exercises
              across all of them. If their buyers exercise, tokens can leave at the strike for
              strike USDG in a week that paid nothing. Whatever is not assigned comes back when the
              week closes. This is published as a row like any other week, not hidden as an error

              and the upside above the strike is gone for that week. v1 does not automatically buy the tokens back.

          the vault&apos;s contracts assigned and the rest not, and that can happen in a week the
          vault&apos;s own listing never filled. The vault then holds a mix of
          collateral and USDG, and a queued withdrawal settled that week pays out in the same mix.

          The vault cannot be upgraded in place. Fixing anything means deploying Vault v2 and
          migrating to it, in public, with depositors moving their own funds. That is deliberate:
          an upgradeable vault is a key that can rewrite the rules under a position that is already
          open. The Callhouse contracts have not been audited.

          <strong>Settlement never reads a price feed.</strong> Whether a call is exercised is
          decided by whoever holds it, and what the vault gets back is decided by Valorem. The
          Chainlink feed is used for two things only: showing a spot price, and gating writes and
          listings so the vault refuses to sell against a stale price. A pause of the Stock
          Token&apos;s own oracle blocks writes and listings the same way. Neither is read when the
          week settles.
